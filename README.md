# Google-Professional-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project
This exploratory analysis case study is towards Capstome project requirement for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The case study involves a bikeshare company's data of its customer's trip details over a 12 month period (JAN 2021 - SEP. 2022). Even though the courses included in this Certificate cover many alternative platforms such as BigQuery for SQL and Tableau for Visualization, for this specific project I've focused mainly on the use of R simply because I could do both data wrangling and analysis/ visualizations in the same platform also, to improve my skills in that programming language. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.

# Case Study: 
How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

# SCENARIO
Marketing team needs to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.

# Characters and teams
1. Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.
2. Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
3. Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.
4. Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program

# About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends

# Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members



# MY FINDINGS

1.	Of 56% of total registered members, 34% use a classic and 23% use an electric bike. Of casual members of 44% in total, 20% use classic, 19% use electric, and 5% use a docked bike. 
2.	No registered member uses a docked bike.
3.	The use of the service for both types of users increases in the summer months, but there is no huge margin between customers (casual and Member) in the number of rides during the summer months. but the difference is more dramatic in the member, which surpasses casual in the number of rides during winter months
4.	Averagely casual customers have the longest trip length each month
5.	There are two distinct peak hours for service use during the week: between 7 – 9 in the morning and between 4-7 in the evening. Members have that propensity and are present during both peaks, although casual users only exhibit a high in the afternoon. Casual users might take public transportation to get to work in the morning and the bike share service to unwind on the way home. Weekend usage increases gradually, peaking for both user categories in the middle of the day. We need more information to support this assumption
6.	A casual rider's excursion lasts longer than twice as long as a members. Keep in mind that this does not imply that casual cyclists cover greater distances. It's also noteworthy to notice that, on average, weekends are associated with both more trips and lengthier journeys than weekdays.
7.	According to PLOT II, the summer season makes the months of June, July, August, and September the busiest of the year for both members and casual riders. Both sorts of clients exhibit the same trend during the dry period (Dec.- Mar.). 
8.	This might be attributed to an outside cause (such as the freezing weather) that may have impeded client needs. 
9.	In contrast, during the course of the entire year, more trips are taken by members than by casual riders.


# RECOMENDATIONS

1.	Consider the possibility of giving memberships with extended ride limitations or weekend memberships as an option. 
2.	Since the number of trips made by casual cyclists peaks between February and August, this is the best time of year to commence the marketing campaign.
3.	In order to encourage riders, especially casual ones, throughout the winter, to give discounts or special offers.
4.	The bike share services can, in addition, be rewarded with discounts to entice casual members to ride longer during the week
5.	To level out demand over the day, offer discounted prices during non-busy hours so casual riders can ride bikes more often.
